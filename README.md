## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS Framework
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor

### What I learned

This project played a crucial role in my personal development as it allowed me to acquire fundamental knowledge about Svelte. I learned about component creation, conditional rendering, and data binding.

### Continued development

However, I recognize that there is room for improvement. Despite having found some ease in executing the project, I realized that I was not able to maintain proper organization. In addition, I believe I may have used more information than necessary. Therefore, for my future projects with Svelte, I intend to deepen my studies even further. My goal is to improve my organization and enhance my skills with this Framework.
